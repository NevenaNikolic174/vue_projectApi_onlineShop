Project Description: Vue.js Online Shop Application with Role-Based Access

This project, developed during the second year of study, involves the creation of a Vue.js-based online shop application that employs advanced features and best practices. The project focuses on implementing role-based access control, optimizing component-based templates, utilizing external APIs, and creating a seamless user experience.

Template Structure and Component Division:
The project emphasizes the optimal organization of the template by dividing it into modular components. This approach enhances code maintainability and reusability, facilitating efficient collaboration among team members.

Integration of Public API Data:
The application leverages public APIs to retrieve data and dynamically display it in blocks on the user interface. These blocks feature relevant images and are equipped with search functionality, enabling users to conveniently explore and find desired items.

User Authentication and Role-Based Access:
A significant aspect of the project is the implementation of user authentication and authorization based on role. Users are authenticated using data from the store, and their details are securely stored in LocalStorage. Access to different pages and functionalities is tailored according to the user's role, ensuring a personalized experience.

Custom Two-Way Binding Inputs:
The project introduces custom input components that facilitate two-way data binding. These custom inputs enhance the user experience on forms, allowing seamless interaction and data manipulation.

User Registration with Validation:
The application includes a user registration feature that incorporates robust validation mechanisms. Input data is carefully validated to ensure accuracy and security. Valid user details are stored in the store, contributing to the creation of a comprehensive user database.

Admin Section for Store Entity Management:
The project incorporates an admin section that enables administrators to manage various entities stored within the application's data store. This section empowers administrators to perform tasks such as adding, modifying, or deleting entities, ensuring efficient content management.

User-Focused Pages Displaying Core Functionality:
The application showcases at least two pages designed for end users. These pages exemplify the core functionality of the online shop, providing users with an intuitive and engaging shopping experience. Features such as product listings, detailed product views, and user interactions are highlighted.

Conclusion:
This project showcases a thorough implementation of modern web development practices using Vue.js. By focusing on role-based access, modular template structure, API integration, and a user-friendly interface, the project delivers a robust online shop application that adheres to industry standards and enriches the learning experience of second-year students.
